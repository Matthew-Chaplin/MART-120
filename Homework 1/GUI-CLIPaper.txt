	The difference between a GUI and a CLI is of course, in the name. The graphical user interface uses a more visual representation of information, while the command-line interface represents information using text. In practice, the graphical interfaces lead to a lot more mouse use and clicking while the command-line interfaces are entirely typing. 
	On a more personal level though, the experience of using them is comparable to the difference between playing Runescape and playing a traditional text-based MUD (I tried out Aardwolf at one point, which is text-based interactions with ASCII graphics). MMORPGs are simply graphical MUDS (and were initially called that before the term MMORPG was coined). The main benefits of a MUD are that they allow for more control, depth and freedom. The same seems to hold true for the command-line interface. It was funny when the mage story came up, since this comparison was already on my mind. 
	I strongly prefer using the graphical interface in both scenarios. It is seemingly much more convenient and intuitive, especially for new users. You don’t have to remember as much. I would gladly sacrifice some freedom to make the other 90% of what I do a better experience. Another small reason would be that it prevents typos. When doing the mage exercise, at one point I made a “fireproobbox” and was wondering why I couldn’t interact with it.
